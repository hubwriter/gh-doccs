# gh-doccs

A GitHub CLI extension to create a new codespace for docs work.

This extension creates a codespaces from the docs-internal repository (assuming you have access to it), and then opens the codespace so that you can start using it.

"doccs" = docs codespace

**Note**: This extension is a simplified, GitHub-Docs-Team-specific, version of the https://github.com/hubwriter/gh-quickcs extension.
